containers in a pod are running on the shared network, meaning containers can communicate using localhost and port number; or same ip address they have in the ifconfig output.

^^ means all the containers in a pod run on same ip address.

NodePort type exposes that port as a service across all the cluster nodes i.e node1IP:portnumber and node2IP:portnumber will also work.
